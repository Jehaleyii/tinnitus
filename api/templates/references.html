<p>Henry et al. argue the need for health care providers across disciplines to work together in caring for patients with tinnitus, from diagnosis to management.  The authors highlight the need for primary care providers to be aware of early signs of tinnitus, and how to work with other providers to ensure these patients receive optimal care.  The article outlines current research on the clinical management of tinnitus, and provides a case study as well as a toolkit for clinicians.</p>
<p>The article was published in the Journal for Nurse Practictioners in 2019.  The authors, James Henry, Libba McMillan, and Candice Manning, are health care professionals and researchers with affiliations at academic research institutions.  The article presents information in a systematic and objective manner, and credible academic journal articles from different disciplines including audiology, otolaryngology, nursing, and medicine are cited throughout.   No conflicts of interest are declared by the authors.</p>
<p>This article helped to inform some of the key points of the presentation, including a description of the symptoms and pathophysiology of tinnitus, non-pharmacological management strategies, and the importance of multidisciplinary teamwork in managing tinnitus. </p>

    <p>Holmes and Padgham conduct a literature review, analyzing a range of databases for material relevant to the knowledge, prevalence, causes, assessment, diagnosis, and management of tinnitus. The authors also review literary discussion of the psychosocial effects of the condition, such as tension, frustration, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and suicidal tendencies. The authors acknowledge that, despite the pervasive nature of tinnitus, which affects millions of people worldwide, there remain considerable limitations in the knowledge, assessment, diagnosis, and management of the condition. Moreover, while the authors' literature review found diverse material on tinnitus published within a selected date range, it also found the condition remains largely unacknowledged and under-discussed within the realm of nursing literature. The authors write that this latter finding contributes to gaps in nursing care for those with tinnitus and recommend improved knowledge and understanding of tinnitus, especially among nursing professionals, in order to ensure patients receive adequate care for their condition and achieve sufficient quality of life.</p>
<p>It should be acknowledged that the review is largely intended for an audience of nursing and other healthcare professionals, the purpose being to raise awareness about current gaps in nursing literature, discuss the implications of those gaps for the care of patients with tinnitus, and recommend improved knowledge and understanding of the condition within the nursing profession -- something key to the provision of truly holistic patient care. </p>
<p>The authors of the literature review are experienced healthcare scholars and medical professionals from the United Kingdom, neither of whom declared conflicts of interest nor the receipt of financial support for the research, authorship, or publication of their literature review. Moreover, the authors maintain an objective tone throughout their literature review, basing their recommendations off of their findings rather than personal bias. The review, which was published in 2011, employs a well-constructed methodology, covering English-language tinnitus literature from the period of 1980 to 2009 via a wide-ranging database search using the keyword “tinnitus”. The review is limited, however, in that it only analyzes English-language material and is restricted by a 29-year date range, and thus may not be fully inclusive or representative of all available tinnitus material. </p>
<p>Still, the review is relevant to a presentation on tinnitus and the nurse’s role in providing education about the condition, including its pathophysiological mechanism, etiology, symptoms, diagnosis, and management. It lays a groundwork of understanding as to why the presenters may have encountered limited options while researching nursing care for patients with tinnitus and the significance of those limitations with regard to the quality of patient education and care.  </p>

<p>Lusk et al. delve into the impacts of everyday noise on health, highlighting it as the predominant cause of tinnitus and unveiling its broader repercussions on various non-auditory health outcomes, including cardiovascular issues, obesity, sleep disturbances, depression, anxiety, and children’s learning and development. By presenting noise exposure as a critical public health concern, the article argues for significant policy revisions, healthcare advocacy, and the forging of institutional partnerships to mitigate these adverse effects, positing that such measures can substantially alleviate the negative health outcomes linked to noise pollution.</p>
<p>Targeted at healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the general public, the article is a rallying cry for collective action against the pervasive threat of noise pollution, advocating for its recognition as a serious health risk. Authored by healthcare professionals affiliated with the American Academy of Nursing, the credibility of the discussion is underpinned by a wealth of expertise, a thorough review of current studies and reputable sources ensuring its arguments are both accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>Published in 2017, the article's incorporation of up-to-date research and policy discussions makes it a timely resource for addressing contemporary issues related to noise pollution. Maintaining an objective tone, the authors advocate for noise reduction based on scientific evidence, grounding their recommendations in well-documented research findings and steering clear of undue bias.</p>
<p>This article not only enhances our understanding of the health implications of noise exposure, particularly highlighting the risks of noise-induced tinnitus from concerts and other sources, but also serves as a cornerstone for educational materials aimed at raising awareness about this issue. Through a succinct narrative, Lusk et al. illuminate the urgent need for awareness and intervention against noise pollution.</p>

  </div>

   <div clas="container" style="padding: 5%">
        <br>
<p>Rademaker et al. perform an analysis of people with tinnitus and those without, comparing primary healthcare consumption between the two groups. Overall, the analysis found that those with tinnitus had more -- an average of four -- primary healthcare visits per year than those without. Additionally, the study found that those with tinnitus were prescribed more medications and were more frequently referred to medical specialists. </p>
<p>The analysis, published in 2021, incorporates data pertinent to the total number of primary healthcare consultations, drug prescriptions, and medical specialist referrals among a Dutch cohort. Electronic health record data were collected from a total of 295 general practices. Though this represents a significantly large cohort size, there are limitations with regard to the definition of a tinnitus patient, as the analysis defined a tinnitus patient as a person with an open episode of tinnitus in 2018, or an electronic health record registration of tinnitus between mid-2017 through the end of 2018. These data are also representative only of a Dutch cohort and therefore not necessarily representative of the experiences of a global patient population with distinct healthcare systems and experiences. </p>
<p>Overall, the analysis, geared toward an audience of healthcare professionals, is timely in that it was published within the past five years and uses objective data and analysis to reach its conclusion. The authors are reliable in that they are medical scholars and professionals. Additionally, the authors declare no competing interests and, though funded by Cochlear, the funder did not have any involvement in the design, collection, analysis, or interpretation of the analysis. </p>
<p>The analysis is pertinent to a presentation on tinnitus as it demonstrates a more significant healthcare need among those experiencing tinnitus than those who do not experience the condition. This is important for the presenters to consider as they examine the role of nurses in meeting the healthcare needs of tinnitus patients, including what those needs are and how those needs are being met.</p>
